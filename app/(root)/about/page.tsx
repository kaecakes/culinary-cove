        <h5 className='h5-bold text-center sm:text-left py-3'>Our Story</h5>
        <p>
            Culinary Cove was born out of a love for food, family, and the desire to create a shared space for culinary adventures. It all started with a kitchen filled with laughter, the clinking of utensils, and the delightful aroma of Grandma's famous lasagna recipe wafting through the air.
            <br/><br/>
            As our family gathered around the table, we realized the magic of sharing recipes and stories, passing down traditions from one generation to the next. But keeping track of all those beloved recipes scattered across cookbooks, websites, and handwritten notes was a challenge.
            <br/><br/>
            That's when the idea for Culinary Cove sprang to life ‚Äì a digital haven where we could preserve our culinary treasures, explore new flavors, and connect with each other through the joy of cooking.
        </p>
